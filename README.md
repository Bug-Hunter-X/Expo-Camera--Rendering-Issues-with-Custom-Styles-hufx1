# Expo Camera Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo `Camera` component with custom styles. The issue results in the camera preview failing to render correctly, sometimes displaying a blank screen or a distorted image.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using Expo Go or a similar method.
4. Observe the camera preview.  You may need to adjust styles in `bug.js` to trigger the bug consistently across devices.

## Bug Analysis

The root cause appears to be a conflict between the custom styles applied to the `Camera` component and Expo's internal rendering mechanisms.  Certain style combinations, especially those that manipulate aspect ratio or dimensions, seem to interfere with the camera's preview rendering.

## Solution

The solution involves careful review and adjustment of the styles applied to the `Camera` component. Often, the solution is removing certain conflicting styles. The file `bugSolution.js` provides an example of applying styles safely. Specific solutions will be device specific and require testing and debugging.

## Additional Notes

This bug is intermittent and its manifestation can depend on various factors, including the device, Expo version, and the specific styles applied. Thorough testing on various devices is strongly recommended.
