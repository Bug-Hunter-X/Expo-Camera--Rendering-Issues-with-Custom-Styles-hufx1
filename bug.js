This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` component with custom styles.  If you apply certain styles, particularly those affecting the aspect ratio or dimensions of the camera preview, the camera may fail to render correctly, resulting in a blank screen or a distorted preview. This is not always immediately apparent and can depend on the specific styling applied and the device the app is running on.
